    "In Lab 1, we saw that the quantum state of a single qubit could be written as linear combinations of the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.  The states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are often referred to as the computational basis states of a single qubit.  When we have 2 qubits, we will need $2^2 = 4$ basis states to describe all possible quantum states of 2 qubits because each qubit could be measured as either a $0$ or a $1$.  The computational basis states used to describe a state of 2 qubits are\n",

In other words, the left most term (the $1$ in $\\ket{10}$) corresponds to qubit $q_0$'s state and the rightmost term will correspond to the state of the 2nd qubit.  Since there is no agreed upon standard ordering of qubits, this notational choice may differ from other quantum programming languages that you might run across.\n",

Additionally, phase helps explain the phenomena of **interference** which is key in algorithms such as Grover's.    \n",

    "Let's take a deeper look at qubit $q_1$ in the `nested_quantum_program` example from the previous section.  We can follow the state of $q_1$ as it changes throughout the kernel execution. We begin in the state $\\ket{0}$ which is flipped to $\\ket{1}$. Then, an application of the $H$ gate takes us to $\\ket{-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}$.

However, if we measured the states $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ with `mx` we could distinguish the two states through their quasi-probability distributions.

    "\n",
    "> **Answer:**  One thing to note is that as the number of qubits increases, the number of possible states increases exponentially and the size of the matrix representing the multi-qubit gate also increases exponentially.  For instance, a 3-qubit system (like the Exercise 4 in the next section) can be in one of $2^3 = 8$ states, and the size of the matrix representing a 3-qubit gate is $8\\times 8$.  This suggests that straightforward attempts at using matrix multiplication to simulate quantum computation on CPUs fail for circuits with only 30 or so qubits.  With CUDA-Q's platform and GPU-accelerated built-in simulators, it is possible to simulate larger systems. That said, there may one day be a fault tolerant quantum computer that can carry out computations too big for even the largest classical supercomputers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Entanglement of two (or more) qubits is akin to the concept of dependence in linear algebra.  That is to say that two qubits are entangled if the state of one of the qubits depends on the other.  Formally the definition of entanglement relies on tensor products, which are beyond the scope of this Quick Start series of notebooks.  You can read more about tensor products and the precise definition of entanglement [here](http://mermin.lassp.cornell.edu/qcomp/CS483.html) or [here](https://qubit.guide).  For now, we'll illustrate entanglement through the example of the 2-qubit state\n",

    "\n",
    "* If our system of two qubits is in the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ and we measure qubit 0 to be $0$, then the state of the system collapses to $\\ket{00}$.  In this case, without taking a measurement on qubit 1, we already know its state (it's $\\ket{0}$).  \n",

    "\n",
    "* Similarly if the state of our system is $\\ket{\\psi}$ and qubit 0 is measured to be 1, then  the state of the system collapses to $\\ket{11}$.  Although prior to any measurement on qubit 0, qubit 1 had a $50\\%$ probability of being in state $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$, after measuring qubit 0 to be 1, we know that qubit 1 must be in the state $\\ket{1}$.\n",

    "In a quantum program, we apply gates to change quantum state from one state to another.

Interference is central in almost every quantum algorithm.\n",

Like the classical interference of waves from raindrops on the surface of a puddle, constructive interference occurs when the probability amplitude of basis state is increased, and destructive interference occurs when the probability of a basis state decreases due to the action of quantum gates.  The previous example demonstrates both constructive and deconstructive interference. The circuit is initialized in a state having equal magnitude probability amplitudes, but after applying the CNOT gate and Hadamard gate, the probabilities of measuring $\\ket{110}$, $\\ket{011}$, $\\ket{111}$, and $\\ket{010}$ have each been amplified, while the probability amplitudes associated with the other basis states have been reduced to $0$.\n",

    "There are many more quantum gates than the handful that we've explicitly used so far.  In the previous lab, we mentioned that any rotation of the Bloch sphere corresponds to a quantum gate on one qubit. So in theory, there are an infinite number of possible quantum gates: one for each of the possible rotations of the sphere.  In this section, we'll first detail what these rotations gates look like both as matrices and as CUDA-Q operations. Then  we'll use these rotations gates to define a larger class of multi-qubit controlled gates.\n",

But how do we implement gates for other angles of rotation, or different axis of rotation?  One easy answer is to use some of the gate operations built into CUDA-Q.  These include the `y`-gate for 180 degree rotation about the $y$-axis and the `z`-gate for 180 degree rotation about the $z$ axis.  The `t` and `s` gates correspond to other fixed angle rotations about the $z$ axis.  \n",

In this scenario, a walker begins in the center of the line.

    "### Discrete Time Quantum Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW)** is the quantum analogue of a classical random walk. In this scenario, both the position of the walker and the coin are represented as quantum states, $\\ket{\\psi_W}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_C}$, respectively. Throughout this walk, the state of the walker changes according to a quantum shift operators ($S_+, S_-$) which depend on the state of the coin $\\ket{\\psi_C}$. In particular, the $S_{-}$ operation checks if $\\ket{\\psi_C}$ in the state $\\ket{0}$ (i.e., heads) and if so, induces a shift left operation on the quantum walker. Similarly, $S_{+}$ is defined for tails and shifting right. At each time step, the state of the coin changes (i.e., is \"flipped\") via a quantum operation ($F$), which we'll call the coin-flip operator. Unlike the classical random walk, we will not know the position of the walker until the end of the process, when the quantum state of the walker is measured, and we'll never know the state of the coin!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram below we illustrate a 2-step quantum walk where the coin-flip operator $F$ is the Hadamard gate.  Notice how the final distribution of the walker's possible positions differs from the classical case. In particular, the state of the walker after 2 time steps is in superposition.  Moreover, upon measurement of the final state, the walker never ends up in the location $4 = |0100\\rangle$, as might occur with two tails in the classical case depicted above.\n",

    "#### The Line that the Walker Traverses\n",
    " For our example, let's consider a line that contains $16$ positions, labeled $0,1,\\cdots,15$.  We can use $4$ qubits and the computational basis states, ($\\ket{\\bf{0}} = \\ket{0000}, \\ket{\\bf{1}} = \\ket{0001}, \\ket{\\bf{2}} = \\ket{0010}, \\cdots, \\ket{\\bf{15}} = \\ket{1111}$), to represent positions on the line.  In other words, the computational basis state $\\ket{\\bf{i}}$ represents the $i^{th}$ location on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Walker's Position State\n",
    "The walker's position after $t$ time steps is given by a linear combination of the computational basis states $$\\ket{\\psi_W(t)} = \\sum_{i}\\alpha_i(t)\\ket{\\bf{i}},$$ for some $\\alpha_i(t)\\in\\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $\\sum_{i}|\\alpha_i(t)|^2 = 1$.  For instance, if the walker began the experiment at position $0$, then the state of the walker at time $0$ would be $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\ket{0000}$.  More interestingly, the walker might begin the experiment in a superposition of two or more positions.  For example, the initial state of the walker could be the positions $2$ and $3$.  In this case the walker's initial state is $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{\\bf{2}}+\\ket{\\bf{3}}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0010}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0011}$ as depicted in the image below.\n",

    "A significant challenge in quantum computing is the efficient encoding of classical data into quantum states that can be processed by quantum hardware or simulated on classical computers. This is particularly crucial for many financial applications, where the first step of a quantum algorithm often involves efficiently loading a probability distribution. For instance, to enable lenders to price loans more accurately based on each borrower's unique risk profile, it is essential to estimate individual loan risk distributions (such as default and prepayment) while accounting for uncertainties in modeling and macroeconomic factors. Efficiently implementing this process on a quantum computer requires the ability to load a log-normal or other complex distribution into a quantum state [(Breeden and Leonova)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2022.2115415).\n",

    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores how to load a probability distribution with a given property (in this case, a fixed mean) into a quantum state. By following this example, you will gain the essential knowledge needed to comprehend more sophisticated algorithms, such as the multi-split-step quantum walks (mSSQW) method, as described by  [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12500) The mSSQW technique can be employed to load a log-normal distribution, which is useful for modeling the spot price of a financial asset at maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pedagogical Remark:** The reason why we chose to examine the coarser problem of generating a distribution with a targeted mean as opposed to generating a targeted distribution itself (as in [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12500)) is that by considering the mean of the distribution we can introduce the concept of expectation value of a Hamiltonian which is central to many variational algorithm applications in chemistry, optimization, and machine learning.  \n",

    "Up to this point, for this step of the quantum program, we utilized `cudaq.get_state` and `cudaq.sample` to read out a statevector from the quantum kernel. However, this approach is not always practical, especially considering that the dimension of the statevector scales exponentially with the number of qubits. For example, describing the statevector for $100$ qubits would require storing $2^{100}$ amplitudes, which is extremely memory-intensive. In many quantum algorithms, we do not need a complete description of the statevector; instead, partial information like an \"average\" value often suffices.
