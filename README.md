# KBM 608 "Hands-on introduction to HPC+QPU" 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository will be updated throughout the semester. Make sure to star and follow for updates! 

These seminar series will serve as an introduction to the practical applications of quantum computing in a HPC+QPU setting. It is designed for students who wish to explore the exciting and rapidly developing field of HPC integrated QPUs. 

This is a hands-on course where you will learn by doing. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks and practical exercises using the common APIs, you will gain practical skills. 

> [!WARNING]  
> Minimum expected skills to be able to follow the course: 
> 1) Basic grasp of Modern physics concepts and basic grasp of linear algebra
> 2) Python 
> 3) Jupyter notebooks (Colab) 

> [!TIP]
> For a good project, you need to have skills on:
> 1) Quantum and Quantum information theory
> 2) git (and preferably a github account) 
> 3) HPC skills.

## Course content: 

1) Quick and dirty introduction to Quantum 
1a) Postulates of Quantum, and consequences in practice
1b) Matrix representation, density matrices.
1c) A quick and dirty introduction to complexity classes for Quantum processor units, and why HPC+QPU is a good idea.
2) Qubits and Circuit model
2a) Qubits 
2b) Your first circuit
2c) How do you visualize the outcome?  
3) Transpilation to hardware, 
4) Noise
4a) Is noise something you always need to eleminate? 
4b) Error cancelation vs mitigation
5) Some useful alghorithms and effects.
(This part will contain some important to understand alghorithms, and practical alghorithms such as VQE, QAOA,  GPT-QE, etc.)

## Assessment Methods:

    Assignments/Midterm (35%): Regular programming assignments to reinforce concepts and build API proficiency.

    Final Project (65%): A small project involving the implementation and analysis of a HPC+QPU alghorithm. 

> [!CAUTION]
> AI policy:
> Ethical use of "AI" tools, such as notebookLM and similar are useful. However keep in mind that "AI" tools can also
> be used in an unethical fashion and especially "chat" LLMs such as chatGPT can be dangerously addictive with long lasting
> mental health and degradation consequences.
